# React-Pardy! --Build Jeopardy clone with React

## Planning Process --
1. Sketch wireframes with endpoints and user events
2. Data modeling with exploration of API
3. Break wireframes into functional components including which components were nested

## Building Process --
1. Constructed router with one endpoint to determine functionality
2. Worked on smallest component first (Single Question) with hardcoded data
3. Fetched data from server and began to build up categories
4. Configured scoring system
5. Styles, styles, styles!

## Challenges --
The biggest challenges for me during this process was understanding the concept of state. This is our first week working with react so it is new territory for me. Many components relied on defining initial state as well as resetting after the components were mounted. This lead to some challenges with removing a question after it was viewed and setting a correct answer to certain colors.

## Improvements --
1. Include a login system to allow for more than one player
2. Include a winning/results screen
3. Include a "new game" button so the user doesn't have to refresh the page. This is something I planned on doing but had difficulty executing.
4. Implement a timer
